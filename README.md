# warsaw-coliving
This repository gathers the code to tokenize the real estate ownership of a startuppers' coliving in Warsaw, Poland.

This property aims to be fractionalized and sold as a collection of NFTs representing a percentage of the underlying real estate. As long as one owns an NFT of this collection, one will receive in its crypto wallet the rental revenue corresponding to the size of its share holding.
